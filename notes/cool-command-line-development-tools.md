## Sempgrep - Static analysis at ludicrous speed, Find bugs and enforce code standards
- https://semgrep.dev/docs

Semgrep is a fast, open-source, static analysis tool for finding bugs and
enforcing code standards at editor, commit, or CI time. Its rules look like the
code youâ€™re searching; no more traversing abstract syntax trees or wrestling
with regexes.
